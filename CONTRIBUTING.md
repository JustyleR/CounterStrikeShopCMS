First off, thank you for trying to help with this project.

## How to help?

There are many ways to help.
First you need to know what you are good at, maybe you have a big imagination and you are good with photoshop, html, css and you can help with the templates. If you are good with PHP you can help with some of the code so we can improve it. Maybe you can just help us with testing the system and finding bugs and stuff.

If you still don't know how to help us, just contact me. :)

## I found a bug, how to report it?

If you have found a bug and you want to report it so we can update the system and make it better, just write to my E-Mail adress: justyler@abv.bg and I'll try to respond as quickly as possible.

**If you have more questions, just contact me.**
